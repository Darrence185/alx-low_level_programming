# Singly Linked Lists in C 
This project is a probe into how to build and use liked lists, when to use them and why to choose them vs arrays. Some of the C programs include:

1. function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
2. function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
3. function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
4. function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
5. function that frees a list_t list.
